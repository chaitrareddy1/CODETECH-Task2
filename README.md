## Project Overview

**Project**:CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION.

**Objective**:
A fraud detection model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Use techniques like anomaly detection or supervised learning with imbalanced data.
## Key Activities

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Import necessary libraries.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Split the data into features (X) and target variable (y).
   - Divide the dataset into training and test sets.
   
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Make predictions on the test set.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis, machine learning, and model implementation.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data seamlessly.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It includes modules for data loading, preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.
